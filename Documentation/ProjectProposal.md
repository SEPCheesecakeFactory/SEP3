# Project Proposal 1: A Gamified Learning Platform

Learning app with gamification features (heavily inspired by Duolingo - collecting points, having a streak, …) with a focus on more traditional learning content (history, math, …)
The most important actor would be the learners, who have their own learning client. Alternatively, another client version could be created for uploading courses (whether by the public or an internal team working on the courses).
Besides the core idea, features like leaderboards, friends, and others could be added. 
Data stored would include user information and course content.

# Project Proposal 2: Health Assistant
An app with a focus on providing information regarding health and well-being, computing, and describing data based on user inputs. 
Actors would involve users trying to optimize their health and well-being, and experts, who would have a space to correct or add information within the app.
