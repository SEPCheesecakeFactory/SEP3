# Problem Domain  
#### Education problem
Education is one of the most important aspects of a life in the civilized population. Basically, humans need it in order to function correctly in todays world, in order to get a job or just communicate with others. "Nowadays around 40% of the global population does not have an access to proper education in language they understand"(PTI & PTI, 2025), and that is a huge problem. Another problem involves gender equality and inequalities in general. Many countries and communities around the world struggle with gender equality in forms of different opportunities for women and men. As a result of that, many countries often have a lower amount of educated women than men despite the equality in their birth rates and sometimes even lower mortality for women. Moreover many disabled people are often not able to attend casual education in physical school.
