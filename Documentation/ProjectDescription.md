# Problem Domain  
#### Education problem
Education is one of the most important aspects of a life in the civilized population. Basically, humans need it in order to function correctly in todays world, in order to get a job or just communicate with others. "Nowadays around 40% of the global population does not have an access to proper education in language they understand"(PTI & PTI, 2025), and that is a huge problem. Another problem involves gender equality and inequalities in general. Many countries and communities around the world struggle with gender equality in forms of different opportunities for women and men. As a result of that, many countries often have a lower amount of educated women than men despite the equality in their birth rates and sometimes even lower mortality for women. Moreover many disabled people are often not able to attend casual education in physical school. This is why digital learning is having more and more impact in the modern world. Not only more people are able to acquire proper knowledge but also everyone can learn at their own pace.

Many of the current digital educational platforms, like Brilliant, Coursera, Udemy require subscriptions or course fees. As a result, low income learners in developing regions cannot afford them.

Despite digital technologies advancing fast, another challange that percists, is that 2.6 billion people remain offline. The digital divide is a major barrier to economic growth and sustainable development, with only 27% of the population in low-income countries that has access to the internet, compared to 93% in high-income ones. (The Digital Divide: A Barrier to Social, Economic and Political Equity | ISPI, 2025)

#### Stakeholders
The primiry stakeholders in the field of education include both learners and knowledge providers from all over the world. 

Many of the current digital educational platforms, like Brilliant, Coursera, Udemy require subscriptions or course fees. As a result, low income learners in developing regions cannot afford them.

Another challenge people across the globe still face is the need of stable internet and modern devices that can could reliably access digital platforms in rural areas with weak connectiviry or while using basic computing devices.
