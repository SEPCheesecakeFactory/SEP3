# Problem Domain  

## Education problem

Education is one of the most important aspects of a life in the civilized population (source). Humans need knowledge in order to function correctly in todays world - from simple communication to career growth, knowledge can improve quality of life in many ways (source). "Nowadays around 40% of the global population does not have an access to proper education in language they understand"(PTI & PTI, 2025). In addition, many countries and communities around the world struggle with gender equality in opportunities for education, which ultimately results in educational disparities and economic inequality (source). These inequalities are not always related to gender, but also physical abilities, social status, and other factors (source). 

## Current Situation

That is why digital free-for-all educational platforms have been on the rise in the recent years, as they can provide knowledge to anyone with an internet connection and a device; thus, minimizing the inequalities in education. (source - fx Duolingo studies)

However, various platforms currently operating focus on different aspects of education, such as language learning, coding, mathematics, science, etc. (source). This leaves many gaps and does not provide a consistent learning experience for users. Additionally, some platforms provide less content that is accessible for free, which can be a significant barrier for low-income users. (source)

Despite digital technologies advancing quickly, another challenge that persists, is that 2.6 billion people remain offline (source). The digital divide is a major barrier to economic growth and sustainable development, with only 27% of the population in low-income countries that has access to the internet, compared to 93% in high-income ones. (Poggi, 2025).

## Stakeholders

The primary stakeholders in the field of education include both learners and knowledge providers from all over the world. Learners can be individuals of all ages, backgrounds, and locations who seek to acquire new skills or knowledge. Knowledge providers can include educational institutions, teachers, tutors, and online platforms that offer educational content and resources. Other stakeholders may include governments, non-profit organizations, and businesses that have an interest in promoting education and improving access to learning opportunities.

Expected Time Commitment Based on 10 ECTS
Each student is expected to contribute a total of 275 hours to meet the 10 ECTS workload requirement, with increased hours in October and November to minimize the workload in December.
Breakdown of Hours for 10 ECTS:
● October:
○ Weeklycommitment: 20 hours per student
○ Total for October: 4×20=80 hours per student
● November:
○ Weeklycommitment: 20 hours per student
○ Total for November: 4×20=80 hours per student
● December(up to December 20):
○ Remaining:115 hours
○ Weeklycommitment: 115/3 ≈ 38 hours per student
○ Total for December: 3×38 =114 hours per student
Total Hours Calculation for 10 ECTS
● Total Hours: 275 hours per student
● Calculation:
○ Total hours = 10×27.5=275 hours
● Thisdistribution ensures the project meets the workload requirement for 10 ECTS, with a reduced workload in December due to a higher time commitment in October and November.
Summary
For each student, it amounts to 275 hours of work to achieve 10 ECTS.
