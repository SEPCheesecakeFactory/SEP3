# Gathering Data

This document provides guidelines and best practices for gathering data effectively and ethically.

## Target Audience

We can't afford to gather huge amounts of data or to be picky about our target audience. Therefore, anyone willing to help can be used for data gathering. Advantages to look for when selecting participants could be in our case:

- being a student (more likely to use study-related apps)
- being a teacher or some other kind of educator (someone with experience creating educational content)
- having administrative experience (knowledge about managing roles and users in an organization)

## Data Gathering Methods

Several methods can be employed to gather data, including:

- **Surveys and Questionnaires**: Gathering quantitative data through structured questions. Use fx Google Forms for simplicity.
- **Interviews**: Conducting one-on-one interviews to collect qualitative insights. (more about this later)
- **Focus Groups**: Facilitating group discussions to explore perceptions and ideas. Might be hard to organize for us.
- **Observations**: Watching how users interact with existing systems or processes. This would involve implementing some sort of tracking, which is out of our scope mostly. However, it could be done in a limited manner with user consent.
- **Existing Data Sources**: Utilizing publicly available datasets or organizational data. This one is probably the easiest way to get data, but might not be very relevant to our specific needs. If we want to create something new, we can't rely on data from only slightly related systems.

## Ethical Considerations

When gathering data, it is crucial to consider ethical implications:

- **Informed Consent**: Ensure that participants are fully aware of the purpose of the data collection and how their data will be used.
- **Anonymity and Confidentiality**: Protect the identity of participants and ensure that their data is kept confidential.
- **Data Security**: Implement measures to safeguard the collected data from unauthorized access.
- **Compliance with Regulations**: Adhere to relevant data protection laws and regulations (e.g., GDPR).
- **Transparency**: Be open about the data collection process and allow participants to withdraw their data if they choose to.

## Surveys and Questionnaires

The point of surveys is to gather a lot of data from many people in a short amount of time. This is done by asking simple questions that can be answered quickly. When creating a survey, consider the following:

- Keep it short and focused: Limit the number of questions to avoid fatigue.
- Use clear and concise language: Avoid jargon and ensure questions are easy to understand.
- Mix question types: Use a combination of multiple-choice, rating scales, and open-ended questions.

### Example Survey Question Templates

- Compare the two provided pictures, and select the one you find more appealing.
- On a scale from 1 to 5, how would you rate your experience with [specific task or product]?
- Suggest a feature you would like to see on the Learning platform.
- What do you think about the [feature] in its current state?

## Interviews

Interviews allow for deeper exploration of participants' thoughts and experiences. They can provide rich qualitative data that surveys may not capture. When conducting interviews, consider the following:

- Prepare a set of open-ended questions to guide the conversation.
- Create a comfortable environment to encourage honest responses.
- Record the interviews (with consent) for accurate data analysis.
- Analyze the responses for common themes and insights.

### Example Interview Questions

- Try to [achieve a specific task], and describe your thought process while doing so.
- What challenges did you face while using [specific feature]?
- If you had to remove one feature from the platform, which one would it be and why?
- If you could add any feature to the platform, what would it be and why?
- If you wanted to [achieve a specific goal], how would you go about it using the current platform?
- Describe your overall experience with the platform. What stood out to you, both positively and negatively?
