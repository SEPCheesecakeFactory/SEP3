# Interview Questions

## What would you want to have in the app differently so that it is better and easier to use?

There could be an option to add group/class/forum so that there are leaderboards only for those groups. The teacher inside the group could be able to monitor progress of his class. Maybe the teacher could be able to post only to a separate class.

## What would you improve about colors?

Overall the color pallet seams right but a bit boring. There could be for example different colors for different category labels.

# Additional Notes

It was not easy to navigate through the system.
