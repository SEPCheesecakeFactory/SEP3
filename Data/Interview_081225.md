# Additional Notes

Too dry, the backgound feels like in a hospital, no motivaiton, feels like an exam and not in a game / learning platform. Looking for something like Duolingo, animations to keep going, sounds, motivation messagges. Even for adults its great. If not, her dopamine addiction is gonna kick in and switch to Instagram/ social media.
