# Interview Questions

## How would you go to learn something about Quantum Physics?

"I see I'm already in some menu with options
I noticed there are some categories with topics,
I'm looking at categories, there is Science, oh, it's here, I'm learning" 

## How would you finish a course, not leaving it?

He managed to click on the finish button after ap. 5 seconds of looking around. He obviously also saw the cancel button in top left but didn't mention it or click on it. 

## What would you like to have in the app?

Interactive questions. When I'm completing courses at work and they have no interactive exercises, I usually just click next because I know the course is long and I want to be done with it already. So, I would like to have there some engaging content, not just text to read.

## Overall experience

"Looks very nice, I really like these learning platforms."
At the end of the interview, he said again "it looks very good" and gave the interviewer a high-five.

# Additional Notes

He was very worried about the sources of data. He said that everything should be approved by someone else, it shouldn't all rely on one person, one teacher. He suggest preventive measures rather than reactive ones but says it is up to us.

He also suggests having some benefits for the teachers, so they have some incentive to create good content. He said that money could be the thing. These incentives should be given for both creating courses and reviewing courses.
