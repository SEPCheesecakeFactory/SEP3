# Interview Questions

## What would you like to have in the app? / What would you not like to have in the app?

### As a learner:
- I think profile is unnecessary, because it doesn't show much information. But you could also add more information here, maybe some password changes
- I'd like to have a preview of available courses without having to register or sign in
- I'd like to see who made the course so that maybe I could follow or study more courses of that specific teacher
- I'd like different amount of XP for different type of questions, so that some people would not just hunt for easy courses to be on top of the leaderboard

### As a teacher:
- It is nice that course draft feature exist, to prevent people learners accesing courses that are not meant to be be in the app.
- I'd like for a tutorial or a guide on how to create lessons
- I didn't notice how to acces edit steps
- I'd liek to have an overview of course steps so that if I want to edit a step of a course I made, I don't have to click through all prvious steps
- I'd like to have drop down menu for course category in creating draft instead of filling it manually
- When in teacher role, maybe you could have another tab for your created coursed.

### As an Admin:
- In search bar, when I type a letter I'd like priority for search results to be given to user's whos username start with this letter
- I'd like to be able to delete a course
- I'd like to see under draft review who created the course
- I'd prefer to have more dropdowns over text fields or to be offered autocomplete
