# Group Contract

## SEP3 Group Contract  
**Course:** Software Technology Engineering 

**Semester:** 3rd Semester

**Date:** 8. September 2025

**Group Members (GMs):**  
- Guillermo Sánchez Martínez  
- Piotr Junosz  
- Alexandru Savin  
- Halil Ibrahim Aygun  
- Eduard Fekete  

## 1. Core Values and Priorities

The group shall adhere to the following principles to guide its work:

- **Democracy:** Decisions are made collectively and fairly.  
- **Respect:** For time, work, effort, and private matters (family, personal obligations).  
- **Efficiency:** Striving for productivity in task completion.  
- **Fairness:** Recognizing and balancing individual strengths and weaknesses.  
- **Peace:** Fostering a harmonious group dynamic.  

## 2. Purpose

Our group aims to successfully complete the SEP3 project and other third-semester group assignments.  
The objectives are as follows:

- Deliver a project that meets acceptable standards, ideally achieving high grades (10–12).  
- Facilitate learning about group dynamics and project-specific competencies for all members.  

### Decision-Making
- Amendments to this contract or significant group decisions must be approved by at least **80% of the members**.  
- All other decisions need to be approved by a **simple majority (>50%)**.  
- All members are entitled to voice their opinions before voting or decision-making occurs.  

### Task Delegation
- Tasks will be initially assigned democratically. Subsequent delegation may occur through agreement among group members.  
- Each task owner is responsible for ensuring the completion of their assigned tasks.  

### Conflict Management
- Members are encouraged to de-escalate conflicts and maintain a positive group dynamic.  
- Negative behaviors or situations should not be met with retaliatory actions.  

### Workload Distribution
- **Fairness takes precedence over equality**; members are expected to contribute based on their capabilities and strengths.  
- Members must respect and accommodate others’ participation by attending meetings, meeting deadlines, and collaborating during classes.  
- Group members should allocate time to assist others as necessary, as no task is entirely individual.  

## 3. Group Expectations

1. **Communication**  
   - Respond to team messages within **72 hours**.  
     - Within **2 hours** if it is about an upcoming hand-in (48 hours before).  
       *(excluding 20:00–10:00, or work-related gaps in schedules)*  
   - Attend all scheduled meetings or inform the team at least **2 hours in advance** of absence.  
   - Join the meeting at the agreed time or inform of delay.  
     - Being delayed without notification = **0.5 missed attendance**.  
     - Not attending = **1 missed attendance**.  
   - GMs can join before the meeting and continue with private matters, but at the agreed time, everyone must be **actively present**.  

2. **Workload**  
   - Equitably distribute tasks among all members.  
   - Notify the team of any challenges or delays promptly.  

3. **Deadlines**  
   - Complete assigned tasks on or before the agreed deadline.  

4. **Code Standards**  
   - Adhere to principles taught in all sessions so far taught in our class.  
   - Learn from and accept others' feedback on code quality.
   - Follow the agreed-upon coding style and conventions.

## 4. Conflict Resolution

- If possible, address conflicts directly with the involved party.
- Unresolved disputes will be discussed as a group.  
- If still unresolved, the matter will be escalated to the project supervisor(s).  

## 5. Accountability

Each team member holds ultimate accountability for the quality, accuracy, and integrity of all work they contribute to the project and all their actions taken within the semester project scope. While assistance may be sought from external sources (including AI tools, other individuals, or online resources), the contributing member is solely accountable for verifying all information and deliverables before integration into the project. The direct responsibility of a source for an error does not transfer or mitigate the team member's ultimate accountability for their submitted work.

To ensure accountability and maintain harmony, a point-based system will track rule violations.  
*The purpose of this system is to bond in the team, not to punish the “bad apples”.*  

**Violations:**  
- Knowingly lying → **1 point**  
- 1 missed attendance → **1 point**  
- Incomplete work without valid reason → **0.5 points**  
- Failure to respond to messages → **0.25 points**  
- Missed deadline → **1 point**  
- Blindly agreeing → **0.25 points**  

**Consequences:**  
- **1 point** → The person has to sing a song during a public karaoke session.

### Tracking System
- Points will be tracked and managed in the main **FigJam page on Figma**.
