Administrators and Teachers can also learn on the platform (they don't need to have separate accounts for that).

Teachers can create courses but they need to be approved by an Administrator before they are visible to Learners.

Teachers can edit any course they are assigned to. They are automatically assigned to any course they create.

Learners can not create or edit courses.
