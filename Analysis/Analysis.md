# FAA (Frequently Answered Answers)

Administrators and Teachers can also learn on the platform (they don't need to have separate accounts for that).

Teachers can create courses but they need to be approved by an Administrator before they are visible to Students.

Teachers can edit any course they are assigned to. They are automatically assigned to any course they create.

Students can not create or edit courses.
